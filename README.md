## JAVA: Sieve of Eratosthenes
The Sieve of Eratosthenes finds a list of prime numbers by eliminating the subsequent factors of each prime number. '2' is defined as the first prime number.
The numbers checked are limited by the truncated integer of the square root of the last possible number in the list. The reason is simple. The smallest prime factor of any number cannot be larger than the square root of the number.
